# DCA Coinbase

Automated dollar cost averaging for BTC, LTC, BCH and ETH on Coinbase.
Inspired by https://github.com/blampe/dcagdax
Added the following features
- automatic deposits
- fixed ledger api dependency package. Had to move the package inside as well
- added percentage buys
- added force flag to buy now regardless of the window check, will ask for confirmation
- added after flag
- added support for geminit and ftx/ftx.us exchanges
- added limit order type support

Note Ftx and Gemini do not support funding over api at the moment. Autofund periodically manually if you plan to use those exchanges.
Ftx and Gemini do not support market order type. Use limit order type with the following flags to successfully execute trade. 
```
--type limit
--spread % to increase ask price to accommodate possible price fluctuation when order is placed. Default: 1
--fee % for exchange commission typically 0.1-0.5 for most exchanges depends on fee exchange and fee tier. Default 0.5
```
Limit order may spend a little less every purchase to accommodate spread and fee. 
Unused portion will be left on exchange and included into a next order. 
## Setup

If you only have a Coinbase account you'll need to also sign into
[Coinbase](https://pro.coinbase.com/). Make sure you have a bank account linked to one of these for
ACH transfers.

Procure a Coinbase API key for yourself by visiting
[https://pro.coinbase.com/profile/api](https://pro.coinbase.com/profile/api). **Do not share
this API key with third parties!**

Run the `dcagdax` binary with an environment containing your API credentials:
For Coinbase
```
$ COINBASE_SECRET=secret \
  COINBASE_KEY=key \
  COINBASE_PASSPHRASE=pass \
  ./dcagdax --help
```

For Gemini
```
$ GEMINI_SECRET=secret \
  GEMINI_KEY=key \
  ./dcagdax --help
```

For Ftx/Ftx.us
```
$ FTX_SECRET=secret \
  FTX_KEY=key \
  ./dcagdax --help
```

Be aware that if you set your purchase amount near 0.01 BTC (the minimum trade
amount) then an upswing in price might prevent you from trading.

## Run in Docker
The application can run in docker with cron. 
Create env file with the following format
```
COINBASE_SECRET=secret
COINBASE_KEY=key
COINBASE_PASSPHRASE=pass
```
Adjust cron.conf as you wish. Note this will run the cointainer in foreground. To detach: Ctrl+P+Q 
Timezone is optionalal -e TZ=... and added for convenience by default cron will run in UTC timezone
```
docker build -t dcagdax .
docker run -t -i --name dcagdax -e TZ=America/Los_Angeles  --env-file .env dcagdax
```

Run docker with automatic start
```
docker run -t -i --name dcagdax -e TZ=America/Los_Angeles  --env-file .env --restart unless-stopped dcagdax
``` 

Follow container output
```
docker logs dcagdax --follow
```


To stop and and remove
```
docker stop dcagdax
docker rm -f dcagdax
```

## FAQ

**Q:** Why do I not see any trading activity from the bot?

**A:** If you have other BTC trades on your account, the bot will detect that as a
cost-averaged purchase and wait until the next purchase window. This is for
people who want to "set it and forget it," not day traders!

**Q:** Why would I use this instead of Coinbase's recurring purchase feature?

**A:** The [fees on recurring
purchases](https://support.coinbase.com/customer/portal/articles/2109597)
(currently a minimum of $2.99 per purchase!) can add up quickly. This
side-steps those costs by automating free ACH deposits into your exchange
account & submitting market orders to exchange with BTC.

**Q:** How should I deploy this?

**A:** You could run this as a periodic cronjob on your workstation or run inside docker container or in the
cloud. Just be sure your API key & secret are not made available to anyone else
as part of your deployment!

**Q:** Which coins can I purchase?

**A:** We support all of Coinbase's products: BTC, LTC, BCH and ETH.

**Q:** Can I buy you a beer?

**A:** BTC 1KZhfEWkwH8A7L1Dm9MoHwUKkrEEHrFjgB
